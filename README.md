# My Dotfiles - Petrichor
These are the dotfiles for my theme that I've called Petrichor. As of now, these currently only have the dotfiles for my current Manjaro setup. I plan to migrate to Arch soon, where I'll be developing HyprPetrichor. All my wallpapers are made by me.

# Background Info
My system is using Manjaro as its operating system (which, like I've said, I plan on ditching for Arch soon). I had originally installed it with XFCE in 2021, but I switched to i3-gaps soon after. This is my first rice, and it was made all by me over the span of a few years, tweaking whenever I found something I wasn't happy with.
